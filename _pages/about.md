Hello world! I'm an incoming 3rd year undergraduate at Cornell University, pursuing a Bachelor's in Mathematics and Computer Science.
My research interests include explainable AI, adversarial machine learning, and computer vision, and I am interested in applying both rigor and intuition to results in machine learning. I am currently completing an REU program under the direction of [Prof. Gregory Ditzler](https://ece.engineering.arizona.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/gregory-ditzler), and conduct research during the school year with [Prof. Samitha Samaranayake](https://cee.cornell.edu/samitha/) in operations research and optimization.
